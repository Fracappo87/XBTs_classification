Introduction
============

Performing machine learning experiments in a rigorous and robust way is a quite demanding, time consuming work. Lots of time is spent studying the nature of the input features space, to identify those directions (or specific combinations of the latter) that are relevant for the prediction of output targets.
Moreover, different learning algorithms can in principle be adopted for solving a given regression, or classification, problem. This enlarges quite significantly the spectrum of computational strategies one can adopt when solving such problems.
This is why the ***XBTs_classification*** software has been devised. This end-to-end system allows scientists to easily process input data, select different types of learning algorithms and input spaces and rapidly check the validity of their strategies.
In this way, scientists can focus more on the statistical nature of the learning problem, while the end-to-end system takes care of the computational aspects.
